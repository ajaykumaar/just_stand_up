# Humanoid Wave RL Report 

## What you tried
The goal of this task is
1) Load a humanoid robot simulation
2) Design a wrapper for the environment to match the training software's specifications
3) Optionally, write test cases to check the wrapper and environment
4) Craft reward functions and employ reward shaping techniques
5) Train an agent to perform a hand wave using PPO or SAC
6) Validate the trained agent and optionally visualize the agent's performance
